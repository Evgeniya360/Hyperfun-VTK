# Hyperfun-VTK
Hyperfun+VTK crossplatform qt based solution for scalar fields analyses

First version. Not cleaned and not fully optimised.

The basic idea is to make fully crossplatform vtk and qt based program for Scalar Fields analyses on base of 
Hyperfun language
Scalar fields sound based visualization support is implemented.
Some new primitives were added to hyperfun as well.
In order to compile hyperfun libs should be added. Source files can be found in hf_attributes folder
